        "\n",
        "When predictors have different units or ranges, the variable with the largest scale may dominate the regression equation, even if it does not have the strongest relationship with the dependent variable.\n",

        "2.Ensuring Coefficient Comparability\n",
        "\n",
        "In regression, the coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable (\n",
        "𝑌\n",
